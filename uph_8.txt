It aims to identify the origin and trajectory of air masses that produce rainfall in the Central Andes and the isotopic composition of the precipitation, as a first step to evaluate recharge and groundwater resources.
It shows that the annual water balance at catchment scale is unsufficient to understand the terrestrial water cycle, as it rarely considers the compartmentalization effects revealed by isotopic data. It suggests a multidisciplinary effort to also analyze the movement and distribution of water particles in time and space, and at a much larger scale.
This paper analyzes the mean transit time and spatial variability of stream waters in tropical alpine ecosystems, aiming to answer how old is stream water and also what is the influence of landscape structures in catchment transit times
This study investigated the impact of Land use / Cover change on water pathways and stream stormflow generation processes.
This study analyses the isotopic composition (oxygen-18 and deuterium) of water from different sources in the Amazon basin. Results show that large rivers and lakes are important sources for evaporation. However, several other sources that were not detected in this study also contribute to the water vapor.
